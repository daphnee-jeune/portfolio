                        I am a self-taught front-end engineer with 2 years of experience. Through online resources like Scrimba, Treehouse, Freecodecamp, and many YouTube channels, I learned HTML, CSS, SASS as a pre processor, and Javascript. 
                        In December 2018, I completed a full-stack development bootcamp, <a href="https://acadgild.com/web-development/full-stack-web-development-training-certification" className="acadgild" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Acadgild</a>, and there, I was introduced to React Js, Node jS, Express JS, and MongoDB.

                        <br />
                        Using the industry's latest trends, I want to collaborate with a team to create fast, responsive, and dynamic single page applications and enhance the user experience.
